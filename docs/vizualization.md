# Vizualization

Vizualizations in the PREMIX paper were produced in R using the RStudio interface and tidyverse packages. We will walk through a few of these plots as examples of different types of vizualizations.

## Time to event plots

We drew heavily on the [excellent survival analysis tutorial written by Emily Zabor](https://www.emilyzabor.com/tutorials/survival_analysis_in_r_tutorial.html) to produce Kaplan-Meier style plots of time to negative MDRO stool culture and recurrent MDRO infection.
