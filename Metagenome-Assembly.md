This page will document the code as well as expected inputs and outputs for assembly of contigs from stool metagenomes sequenced for the PREMIX study.

## 1 - Naming convention

In the PREMIX study, **consented participants** were assigned sequential unique identifiers as **PM--**. Participants were found to not have an MDRO on screening stool culture after consent or were unable to complete a visit cycle as specified in the protocol were not included in analyses or in the publicly available datasets. **Consented stool donors** were similarly assigned sequential unique identifiers as **SD--**, however a single donor was used for all treatments in PREMIX.

**Visits** were conducted in 36-day blocks in one of three visit cycles (i.e. 0, 1, 2). Cycle 0 was an observation visit cycle without administration of FMT. Cycles 1 and 2 were FMT visit cycles. Visits were in person on Days 1, 15, and 36, with an additional stool specimen collected on Day 2. Visits were coded by cycle and day as C-D-- (e.g. C1D36, C0D15).
